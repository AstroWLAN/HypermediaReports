\section{Abstract}
This project is about designing and implementing the website of a nonprofit organization called Anemone,
whose purpose is to assist women who are abused or in need of assistance.
The design process, as outlined in this document, comprised four main stages :
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conceptual Design}\\
    In this initial phase, the fundamental functionalities of the website were delineated, 
    encompassing both \textit{in the large} and \textit{in the details} levels. 
    A website tree was delineated in accordance with the IDM specifications, 
    accompanied by a definition of the content organization within the pages.
    \item \textbf{Visual Design}\\
    The visual design process involved the creation of low-fidelity wireframes to facilitate a shared understanding 
    of the final page layout and to streamline the implementation phase. 
    Following this, high-fidelity mock-ups were created to demonstrate the page content as well as its interaction capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Interaction Scenarios}\\
    Multiple use case scenarios were then defined in order to demonstrate the website's structural and 
    design integrity across the majority of its pages.
    \item \textbf{Database Design}\\
    Lastly, we furnish the Entity Relationship diagram and the relational tables of the database,
    enhancing comprehension of the backend structure of the implemented website.
\end{itemize}
