\section{Conceptual Design}
\subsection{CIDM Diagram}
The general structure of the website was defined using the C-IDM in the large notation. 
This method ensures that particular attention is paid to the relations among topics within groups and their cardinality, 
which is defined as the expected minimum and maximum number of instances of a topic or relation.

A detailed preview of the page content was crafted using the C-IDM in the small notation, presented as Content Tables.

\subsection{Mapping}
The content tables in the preceding section have the same name as the pages they represent. 
The following section presents the manner in which they are connected.

\subsection{PIDM Diagram}
The P-IDM notation was used to define the navigation capabilities of the website. 
This resulted in a tree-like structure with the homepage as the root, from which every page is eventually reachable.
