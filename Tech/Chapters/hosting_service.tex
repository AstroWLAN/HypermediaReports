\section{Hosting Service}

We have chosen Vercel and Supabase as our website and database hosting services.

We opted for Vercel because it is easy to use and offers a free tier for small websites like ours. Vercel provides a seamless deployment process, automatic Git integration, and a global CDN, which ensures fast load times for our users. While Azure and AWS offer more extensive services and customization options, they are better suited for complex, large-scale, or highly customized applications. For our needs, Vercel's simplicity and efficiency make it the perfect choice.

Similarly, we selected Supabase for our database hosting. Supabase provides the simplicity and ease of use we require, along with real-time capabilities and built-in authentication. It offers a comprehensive set of features that cater to our needs without the complexity of larger platforms. Like Vercel, Supabase has a free tier that is suitable for our project size, making it an excellent match for our requirements.

\subsection{Render Mode - SSR }
We adopt SSR in our project because it provides fully rendered HTML to search engines, allowing them to index the content more effectively. This is crucial for SEO optimization. In our project, we hope that more and more people can find it through search engines like Google and Bing to help hopeless women. Thus, SSR is the best choice compared to CSR and SSG.
