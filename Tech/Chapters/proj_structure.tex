The subsection introduces the project structure , pages directory structure and server endpoint.
\subsection{Overview Structure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item assets/: This folder is for uncompiled assets such as public js and css files.
	
	\item components/: This folder is for Vue.js components. Components are reusable elements that you can use across different parts of your application.
	
	\item layouts/: This folder contains layout components. Layouts are used to define the structure of your pages. For instance, you might have a default layout and a dashboard layout.
	
	\item pages/: This folder contains your application's views and routes. Each file in this directory automatically becomes a route in your app.
	
	\item plugins/: This folder is for JavaScript plugins that need to be run before instantiating the root Vue.js application.
	
	\item public/: This folder contains static files used to serve publicly that you want to be publicly.
	
	\item server/: This folder is used for server-side related code, such as API routes or middleware.
	
	\item SQL/: This folder seems to be intended for database-related files, which might include SQL scripts or database schema files.
