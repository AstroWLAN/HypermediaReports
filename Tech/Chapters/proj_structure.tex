The server/ directory is used for backend services, while the pages/ directory is for website page endpoints.

\subsection{Server Endpoint}
The website only shows the information including the employees, service and projects, thus all APIs are GET methods.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item GET /api/employee?query=\{id\}: Fetches the full content of a specific exployee identified by its ID. If no ID is provided, it returns all employees that match the query condition.
	\item GET /api/project?query=\{id\}: Fetches the full content of a specific project identified by its ID. If no ID is provided, it returns all projects that match the query condition.
	\item GET /api/service?query=\{id\}: Fetches the full content of a specific service identified by its ID. If no ID is provided, it returns all services that match the query condition.
\end{enumerate}
