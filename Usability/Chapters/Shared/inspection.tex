% Overall overview of the adopted inspection procedure
\section{Inspection}
The inspection phase of the usability evaluation process is a fundamental step to identify potential problems and to assess the website's compliance with the selected heuristics. 
This procedure was organised in two main steps: the individual inspection and the search for a common agreement among the group members.
To this end, the group met on a weekly basis to identify the heuristics to be used and to discuss the results of the individual inspections.

% Description of the utilized metrics 
\subsection{Metrics}
The group decided to use a numerical scale from 1 to 5 (including half points) to rate the website's compliance with the selected heuristics.
In general, ratings of 4 or 5 were given when no significant problems were identified, except for minor deficiencies. 
Even if there are significant deficiencies, a score of 3 indicates adequacy. 
Scores of 1 or 2 indicate significant deficiencies or dysfunctionality in relation to the topic under consideration.
