% Overall overview of the adopted inspection procedure
\section{Inspection}
The inspection phase of the usability evaluation process is a fundamental step to identify potential issues and to evaluate the website's compliance with the selected heuristics. 
This procedure has been organized in two main steps : the individual inspection and the search of a common agreement among the group members.
In order to do so, the group met on a weekly basis to identify the heuristics to be used and to discuss the results of the individual inspections.

% Description of the utilized metrics 
\subsection{Metrics}
The group decided to adopt a numerical scale from 1 to 5 ( considering also half points ) to evaluate the website's compliance with the selected heuristics.
Generally ratings of 4 or 5 were given when no significant issues were identified, except for minor flaws. 
Even when substantial shortcomings exist a rating of 3 indicates adequacy. 
Scores of 1 or 2 underline significant deficiencies or dysfunctionality concerning the topic under consideration.
