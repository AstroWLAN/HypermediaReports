\section{Abstract}
The objective of this document was to conduct a usability assessment of the website
\begin{center}

\end{center}
We can discern two primary sections: inspection and user testing. 
\subsubsection{Inspection}
For the website inspection, we selected eleven heuristics from the MILE set, in addition to those from Nielsen.
Each team member conducted individual analyses, and the results were collectively discussed to pinpoint the most critical issues.
Regarding the shared results, we opted not to calculate the average value of the individual assessments, recognizing that details missed during personal inspections could significantly alter the previously provided evaluations.
The collaborative assessment did not unveil any significant critical issues on the site; however, there is still considerable room for improvement in certain areas.
Specifically, our evaluation uncovered a prevailing sense of disorientation during navigation, coupled with a lack of consistency.

\subsubsection{Testing}
To streamline the tests, we crafted a set of high-level tasks without delving into detailed instructions on execution. 
We meticulously recorded the time taken for each task by every participant and then set thresholds to assess test outcomes as either successful or unsuccessful. 
Due to logistical constraints, we conducted some tests remotely rather than in person.
The participants were unable to interact with us in any capacity. Our focus was solely on gathering personal and non-personal feedback regarding the site's usability.
The majority of the tests were conducted using a PC, with some testers specifically tasked to evaluate the site from a mobile device.
The tests corroborated many of our personal impressions, shedding light on some aspects that we had not previously considered, such as the subpar experience of using the site from a mobile device.
